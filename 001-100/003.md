# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (Medium)

```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```

## Example 1:

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```


## Example 3:

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

## solution

```js
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  var stringMap = {},
      max = 0,
      start = 0,
      len = s.length,
      i = 0,
      str;

  for (i; i < len; i ++) {
     str = s[i];
     start = (str in stringMap) ? Math.max(start, stringMap[str] + 1) : start;
     stringMap[str] = i;
     max = Math.max(max, i - start +1);
  }

  return max;

};

```
